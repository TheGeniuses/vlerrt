BUG:
 - clicking on the drawing may sometimes draw a different tree (larger).

World handling:
   - 'Customized' generation of worlds (text file parsing, random, etc.)
   X Separating drawing from world info.
   - Preserving worlds between iterations.
   - Timer-based iterations...
   X Collisions with the world barriers.
   - Maybe a simple (manual) world editor?
   
   
 Distance update:
 
 Each point carries information about its distance factor.
 
 The distance factor has a value between 0 and \Top.
 
 Search has methods to give you the next increase and next decrease
 	- Linear / Log / Exponential.
 	
 If collision 
 	decrease
 else
 	increase
 	
Use the "complex" KD tree that allows distance.

 Testing & Evaluation:
 
  - Write up the several worlds.
  - Run a search for a X amount of time
  - Parameters
     - Starting value for epsilon
     - Starting value for d'
     - Run time

  - "Parse" the search 
  		- Found the goal or we didnt
  		- Number of nodes in the tree
  		- World coverage (distance travelled?)

  - "Shake up" the world for replanning
